A suite of game development tools written in [Rust][rl], intended for use with
the [Amethyst][am] engine. This project is a *work in progress* and is very
incomplete; pardon the dust!

## Vision

One of the goals of [Amethyst][am] is to split up the traditional "mega-editor"
seen in many other game engines into several small but well-integrated tools,
adhering to the [Unix philosophy][up]. This approach allows for nifty things
like:

[up]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy

* Piping and streaming data between tools like regular Unix commands.
* Network transparency (e.g. mirroring gameplay from your development machine
  onto a testbed computer or smartphone).
* Customizing your workflow to your liking with plain ol' shell scripts.
* Stripping out tools you don't want or need, or easily supplanting them with
  third-party utilities.
* Serving as backends for various "mega-editors" provided by third parties or
  written in-house.

## Toolchain

At the moment, there is only one tool available in this distribution. Please
suggest ideas for more tools on [our issue tracker][it].

* [Amethyst Build Tool][ab] - Command-line tool for managing Amethyst projects,
  intentionally very similar to [Cargo][ca].
